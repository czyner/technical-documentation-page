            A planner app is a modern way of organizing things such as schedule or tasks that 
            one needs to accomplish depending on the time that was given. When we say modern way, 
            this means that no more papers and pens are needed for someone to create their own plans 
            in their lives. They can just install the planner application that they prefer on their 
            gadgets and they are already good to go.
